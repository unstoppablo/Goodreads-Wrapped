The dialogues feel eternal and often obtuse. They fail to enact his principles and his teachings in the same effective way the first third of the book did. <br/><br/>The first 30 percent of the book is great. 40-70% through, the book slows down and it definitely felt like I needed to power through. The final 30% was enjoyable, but mostly from the Alfred side.<br/><br/>The Alfred side, although deplorable beyond explanation, is far more interesting because it’s more story and less eternal dialogue between two characters.<br/><br/>Interestingly enough, the epilogue, once the story ends and the author writes in a non-fictional, historical-account manner, are among the strongest parts of the book. <br/><br/>Overall, a good read that I would not repeat.

There’s also some interesting depictions sometimes. Those are probably the only positive notes I have from this book.<br/><br/>Maali is unbearable and absolutely unlikeable. He is pompous, disloyal, and honestly hard to root for. He’s extremely rude to his mother, constantly cheats and lies to the person that loves him most, and keeps committing poor choices even once he’s dead.<br/><br/>The second person style narrative was simply not for me. That’s a personal gripe and I understand how some may like it. I found it to be tedious and not really offer anything to the narrative. The narrative itself is often either full of unnecessary details or stacked with dialogue which often can be confusing as it does not mention who said what—even more when it’s between 3+ characters. <br/><br/>Funny enough, even when the conversation is between 2 characters that don't include Maali, it's so hard to figure out who is who because of how generic the characters are.<br/><br/>There is no tension whatsoever from page 100 till the very end. None. Nothing seems to matter. The end with the section about The Light seems rushed. <br/><br/>More gripes: the way Stanley talks is idiotic and cartoon-like. <br/><br/>Narrative plot holes and story gripes:<br/>- why does Dr Ranee want to help Maali. It makes no sense. It’s even mentioned in the ledger at the end of the book to avoid unnecessary confrontations (butchering and abbreviating) <br/>- what even is the point of the people in white cloaks<br/>- what is the point of that leopard near the end<br/>- the Mahakali was so useless and under-utilized<br/>- who is the antagonist supposed to be? <br/><br/>Honestly, it’s a shame because it could have been a wonderful story had it been written in another style. Kazuo Ishiguro would have killed it.<br/><br/>I’m glad people liked it though. I’m bummed I didn’t.

I’m not the biggest fan of the writing style, and it can get confusing when there are more than 2 characters in a scene and they are all referred to by “el”. The writing is also uninspiring, but again, it’s carried by a unique premise. You can BET this will be a tv show within the next decade.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: <br/>The last 100 pages of the book seem to lead to a logical conclusion, or maybe a continuation for future books. The protagonist is continuously in disagreement with society and the cannibalistic society around him, as well as the inhumane treatment of the humans that are considered, quite literally, not humans (hence inhumane). <br/><br/>He seems to be getting along with Jazmine, the “product” he was gifted against his will, and begins to grow appreciation and care for her. He even begins to lash out against his sister and other members of society around him that engage in these cannibalistic, inhumane behaviors.<br/><br/>Yet, in the last page of the book, after begging for his ex wife to come and help with the sudden issue of Jazmine’s labor (apparently his unborn son is in trouble), the wife helps Jazmine give birth to the child and then Marcos (protagonist) kills her, to which the wife exclaims “why?! We could have gotten so many more children from her?”<br/><br/>This is meant to serve as a twist that he never really cared for Jazmine, maybe. Or perhaps that he was in on this with his wife all throughout and this was the plan. However, this doesn’t work. Here’s why (or so I think):<br/><br/>- The narrator seems to be at least partially omnipresent: always knows about Marcos, his thoughts, and his surroundings (including the characters around)<br/>- We see Marcos’ disgust at society, the inhumane treatment of the “products”, his disgust at his sister (even calling her a hypocrite)<br/>- We see Marcos stop talking to his ex wife, distancing himself more and more from her, all while also growing closer to Jazmine<br/>- Marcos cares for Jazmine to the point where he sings to her, wishes she could talk, communicates with her and cares for her, checking on her and hoping that people don’t find out about them (the argument could be made that he cares for her as a “pet”, which is even more shocking and horrible considering what occurs in the book)<br/><br/>SO, with all of this in mind, the last page’s twist just seems kind of unfounded. There is little to no basis for it, in my opinion. Maybe the narrator also gets tricked. Who knows.<br/><br/>Regardless, it’s a wild book and you can bet that it’ll become a tv show within the next decade, probably by HBO (if it’s in English) or by Netflix (if produced by Argentine filmmakers)",,,1,0

He wishes he could stop the nausea, the awareness of being. But existing, the self realization of it, happens or it doesn’t. It doesn’t come slowly, but rather appears rapidly. <br/><br/>The awareness of existing can be tiring, and this nausea, this desire to not think about it, is part of existing itself.<br/><br/>Roquentin sometimes feels like he exists passively, and when he gets the moments of self awareness he is nauseated. He struggles with a meaning? Or looks down at those that feel that one must find meaning in their own lives despite an inherently meaningless universe.<br/><br/>Yet near the end he manages to achieve a connection through the record he enjoys listening to. He imagines the existence of the person who wrote the record, and the lady who sings it. He imagines their hardships and the little they might have expected to receive from the record, yet the tiny pieces of happiness any amount of success might’ve brought. Even if it’s 50 dollars for the bills.<br/><br/>He imagines that, although his happiness for the writer and singer might mean nothing to these individuals, if Roquentine himself was in this position, he would be touched. <br/><br/>Existence might still be unbearable and unbeatable, but he can at least, in some way, create something that transcends it, like the record’s tune, which exists despite scratches or blemishes. The record’s tune would still exist, abstractly, with the only mean—or one of the many—of existing in our existence being via the record. Yet, if the record were to be destroyed, it would still be somewhere, on the other side.<br/><br/>Maybe, he thinks, by creating something—a book, as that is all he claims to be capable of—he could leave something that is beyond existence. He would not beat it, nor would creating the book help him beat the nausea, but it would leave something for later.<br/><br/>Perhaps as a touching end, I remember that the beginning of the book has an editor’s note meaning that, in one way or another, Roquentine succeeded.<br/><br/>I might have totally misunderstood the book, but I appreciate what I took from it nonetheless.<br/><br/>———<br/><br/>Other than maybe 10-20 pages that didn’t catch me entirely (around the middle) with endless descriptions (due to his Nausea), it is an absolutely wonderful book.<br/><br/>4.5/5",true,,1,0
