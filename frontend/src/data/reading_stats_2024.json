Before the last 10 pages, I was ready to give it a 6.5-7/10. After I finished it though, it easily merits a 7.5-8/10. <br/><br/>Worth the read, in my opinion. <br/><br/>‚ÄúI was dealt my cards and I played them.‚Äù ",

I cared for every single character, and every single character felt alive and unique. At no point whatsoever did I get bored of the book, or think that something could have been better. <br/><br/>The book captivated me, shocked me, and left me wanting to start all over again. I felt like I was about to tear up at times. <br/><br/>Without a doubt, this is a masterpiece a...",

I liked Tommy and Kath‚Äôs friendship. <br/><br/>Overall, not a lot happens in terms of ‚Äústory completion‚Äù. They just lived their life and Katy narrates it. Again, enjoyable, but not sure if I‚Äôd read it again. <br/><br/>",
