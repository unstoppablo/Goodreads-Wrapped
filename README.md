# Goodreads-Wrapped

Like Spotify Wrapped, but for books on Goodreads.

**TO DO**

- fix api pull to get book covers consistently
- host on a website and test
- ensure that if the page reloads, we dont rerun the entire python script and redownload all images, that needs to be cached
- Write a nice readme detailing how to access it, main functionality, etc. Include nice screenshots.
- progress bars are needed for story components
- fix issue when no books are found bug so it doenst auto proceed

## flow

1. **TO CODE:** Instruction page

- Link to download csv from goodreads
- Button to upload csv from goodreads

2. **TO CODE:** Load page with some animation, explain this will take 1 minute ish

- Should be able to load in the background
- Basic explanation of how this works (tap left, tap right, green bar indicates all animations for this page were shown so you didn't miss anything)
- Option to proceed when ready
