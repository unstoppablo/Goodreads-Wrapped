To my surprise, I rate it the exact same.<br/><br/>It has an extremely strong and captivating start, muddled with spells that are uninteresting or somewhat tedious.

Then it’s just stupid. <br/><br/>The writing at many points tries to be dramatic in a way that reads like a teenage novel. In general it lacks depth, both in prose and general storytelling. <br/><br/>A lot of things are not explained—that’s fine, usually, but here it just seems like they truly didn’t know how to and decided to just end the book while shrugging “eh who knows, right?” <br/><br/>Would nev..."

After that, it’s countless chapters of yapping, weird horny moments, and down right weird parts that would simply not fly in the last 3 decades almost anywhere in the world.<br/><br/>It’s a shame. The first book is a masterpiece. The second one is really good. But you can see the sharp decline in this one. I’ll still finish the tetralogy at some point this year, but definitely disappoint..."

But still not enough.<br/><br/>The world building is great and the story itself is really interesting. However, the writing style was just not for me. A lot of times it really was a h@ssle to keep reading.<br/><br/>The ending of the book is really strong though. <br/><br/>Overall, 5/10, maybe a 6. <br/>"
